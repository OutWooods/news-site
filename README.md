# News Website

This is just a rough page I want to deploy, which keeps links to all the news pages I like to us. 

There are fancier sites for this, but often I find them unweildy. So I thought I'd just put together a page of links. That I can expand on to fit my needs. 

This is not an example of high quality code, just the simplest way to achieve what I want to do. If it sticks, it sticks. If it doesn't, it took about half an hour to do.
